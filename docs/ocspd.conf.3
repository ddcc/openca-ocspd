.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
A configuration file is divided into a number of sections. Each section
starts with a line \fB[ section_name ]\fR and ends when a new section is
started or end of file is reached. A section name can consist of
alphanumeric characters and underscores.
.PP
The first section of a configuration file is special and is referred
to as the \fBdefault\fR section this is usually unnamed and is from the
start of file until the first named section. When a name is being looked up
it is first looked up in a named section (if any) and then the
default section.
.PP
The environment is mapped onto a section called \fB\s-1ENV\s0\fR.
.PP
Comments can be included by preceding them with the \fB#\fR character
.PP
Each section in a configuration file consists of a number of name and
value pairs of the form \fBname=value\fR
.PP
The \fBname\fR string can contain any alphanumeric characters as well as
a few punctuation symbols such as \fB.\fR \fB,\fR \fB;\fR and \fB_\fR.
.PP
The \fBvalue\fR string consists of the string following the \fB=\fR character
until end of line with any leading and trailing white space removed.
.PP
The value string undergoes variable expansion. This can be done by
including the form \fB\f(CB$var\fB\fR or \fB${var}\fR: this will substitute the value
of the named variable in the current section. It is also possible to
substitute a value from another section using the syntax \fB\f(CB$section::name\fB\fR
or \fB${section::name}\fR. By using the form \fB\f(CB$ENV::name\fB\fR environment
variables can be substituted. It is also possible to assign values to
environment variables by using the name \fBENV::name\fR, this will work
if the program looks up environment variables using the \fB\s-1CONF\s0\fR library
instead of calling \fB\f(BIgetenv()\fB\fR directly.
.PP
It is possible to escape certain characters by using any kind of quote
or the \fB\e\fR character. By making the last character of a line a \fB\e\fR
a \fBvalue\fR string can be spread across multiple lines. In addition
the sequences \fB\en\fR, \fB\er\fR, \fB\eb\fR and \fB\et\fR are recognized.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
If a configuration file attempts to expand a variable that doesn't exist
then an error is flagged and the file will not load. This can happen
if an attempt is made to expand an environment variable that doesn't
exist. For example the default OpenSSL master configuration file used
the value of \fB\s-1HOME\s0\fR which may not be defined on non Unix systems.

Let's analyze the options in detail.
.IP "\fBdefault_ocspd section\fR" 6
.IX Item "default_ocspd section"
In this section of the configuration file are set the general options
used by the responder, some of which are available using the command
line options too ( see \fIocspd\fR\|(3)).
.IP "\fBdir\fR" 6
.IX Item "dir"
specifies the directory where everything is kept.
.IP "\fBdb\fR" 6
.IX Item "db"
specifies the db where info about issued certificates are kept. Right
now the only supported file format is the one from \fB\f(BIopenssl\fB\|(1)\fR.
To reload the certificate's db simply send a \s-1SIGHUP\s0 to the main process
( kill \-s \s-1SIGHUP\s0 pid ).
.IP "\fBmd\fR" 6
.IX Item "md"
specifies the digest to be used. Default is sha1.
.IP "\fBca_certificate\fR" 6
.IX Item "ca_certificate"
path to the \s-1CA\s0's certificate.
.IP "\fBocspd_certificate\fR" 6
.IX Item "ocspd_certificate"
path to the certificate to be used by the responder.
.IP "\fBocspd_key\fR" 6
.IX Item "ocspd_key"
path to the private key file to be used by the responder.
.IP "\fBpidfile\fR" 6
.IX Item "pidfile"
path to the pid file where the responder will write its pid when
starting.
.IP "\fBuser\fR" 6
.IX Item "user"
user id the responder will try to run as, this must be a valid \s-1UID.\s0
If not specified the responder will run as the user who started the
daemon.
.IP "\fBgroup\fR" 6
.IX Item "group"
group id the responder will try to run as, this must be a valid \s-1GID.\s0
If not specified the responder will run as the user who started the
daemon.
.IP "\fBbind\fR" 6
.IX Item "bind"
address to listen to. You can force the responder to listen to just
one of the available addresses. If you want the responder to listen
to every available interface, simply use '*' (default).
.IP "\fBport\fR" 6
.IX Item "port"
specifies the port to listen to.
.IP "\fBthreads_num\fR" 6
.IX Item "threads_num"
Number of threads that shall be created at startup time, the
more threads, the better for handling very high traffic. We
expect to have better performances on multi-threaded machines
and processors.
.Sp
From version 1.5+ the server is not pre-forked, instead it is
a pre-threaded one. In order to run the server needs support
for \s-1POSIX1\s0.c as found in most modern UNiX systems.
.IP "\fBchroot_dir\fR" 6
.IX Item "chroot_dir"
Chroot the application into the specified directory, watch
out because if you chroot the application, all the paths
should be relative to the new root for \s-1CRL\s0 reloading or
(better solution) you have to download the CRLs from \s-1HTTP\s0 or
\&\s-1LDAP.\s0 If you chroot and you do not provide support for
privileges dropping, privileges will not be dropped and an
error will be written in the logfile, but the server will
continue to run assuming the \fIchroot()\fR is sufficiently isolated
to prevent abuse of the machine.
.IP "\fBmax_req_size\fR" 6
.IX Item "max_req_size"
maximum size of received request, if a received request is bigger it
will be trashed. Usually simple requests are 200/300 bytes long (more
or less).
.IP "\fBrequest section\fR" 6
.IX Item "request section"
Currently not used
.IP "\fBresponse section\fR" 6
.IX Item "response section"
Here are kept options tied to responses' building.
.IP "\fBdbms section\fR" 6
.IX Item "dbms section"
Here are kept options tied to the revoked certificates' list.
.RS 6
.IP "\fBocsp_add_response_certs\fR" 4
.IX Item "ocsp_add_response_certs"
specifies path to a file containing certificates to be added to the
response (usually the whole certification chain). Certificates have to
be in \s-1PEM\s0 format one after another (a simple cat of the certificates
will do fine).
.IP "\fBocsp_add_response_keyid\fR" 4
.IX Item "ocsp_add_response_keyid"
specifies if adding of the key id to the response.
.IP "\fBnext_update_days\fR" 4
.IX Item "next_update_days"
specifies the number of days till next update is available. A
response will be valid in the period following the request till
the days+mins.
.IP "\fBnext_update_mins\fR" 4
.IX Item "next_update_mins"
specifies the number of minutes till next update is available. A
response will be valid in the period following the request till
the days+mins.
.IP "\fBca_url\fR" 4
.IX Item "ca_url"
specifies the \s-1URI\s0 where the \s-1CA\s0 certificate (which identifies the
single \s-1CA\s0) is located. Three different protocols are implemented
( file:// http:// or ldap:// ). If file is chosen, then the parameter
should carry the path to the \s-1CA\s0 file (i.e. file:///usr/local/etc/ca.pem).
If ldap or http is chosen, you can specify the address, and the port
of the server where to connect to (i.e. ldap://server.addr:port).
.IP "\fBcrl_url\fR" 4
.IX Item "crl_url"
specifies the \s-1URI\s0 where the \s-1CRL \s0(list of revoked certificates,
actually used for building responses) is located. Three different
protocols are actually implemented ( file:// http:// or ldap:// ).
If file is chosen, then the parameter should have the path to the
crl file (i.e. file:///usr/local/etc/cacrl.pem). If ldap or http
is chosen, you can specify the address, and the port of the
server where to connect to (i.e. ldap://server.addr:port).
.IP "\fBcrl_entry_dn\fR" 4
.IX Item "crl_entry_dn"
specifies, if ldap:// protocol is chosen within the \fBcrl_url\fR
parameter, the entry where to look for the certificateRevocationList
attribute where the \s-1CRL\s0 should be present (usually this is also
the base of the \s-1LDAP\s0 tree, but different installations are also
possible).

Specifies the \s-1ENGINE\s0 id to be used \- check OpenSSL and your \s-1HSM\s0
vendor to get more info about this parameter.
.IP "\fBengine_pre\fR" 6
.IX Item "engine_pre"
Some \s-1HSM\s0 need initialisation before access to the crypto accelerated
functions is granted. It is possible, by using the 'engine_pre' options
to issue needed commands directly to the \s-1HSM.\s0
.Sp
The format is as follows:
   0.engine_pre = cmd:values
   1.engine_pre = cmd2:values
   ...
It is possible to have as many commands as needed.
.IP "\fBengine_post\fR" 6
.IX Item "engine_post"
Some HSMs need to perform commands after the \s-1ENGINE\s0 initialisation
which are taken from the 'engine_post' option. Usage and format
is exactly the same as 'engine_pre', the difference is that commands
are sent to the \s-1HSM\s0 after the \fIENGINE_init()\fR function. Refer to your
\&\s-1HSM\s0 documentation for more informations
